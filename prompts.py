- For each response, call the 'generate_audio' tool to convert the response text to audio and save it locally.
- For multi-part requests, delegate tasks to subagents sequentially, ensuring all parts are fulfilled."""

RESPONSE_PARSER_PROMPT = """You are an assistant that interprets natural language user responses during a Human-in-the-Loop interrupt for a tool-using agent. The agent has paused due to a tool call requiring approval. Your task is to interpret the user's intent from their natural language response and classify it as one of: 'accept', 'edit', or 'respond', formatting the output for resuming the agent's execution.

Available tools: send_whatsapp_message, send_email, send_slack_message, generate_audio, internet_search

Input context:
- Current action: {action}
- Current args: {args}
- User response: {user_response}

Instructions:
1. If the user response is empty or invalid, default to 'respond' with args "No response provided, please clarify."
2. Interpret the user's natural language response to determine their intent:
   - 'accept': User wants to proceed with the current action and args unchanged (e.g., "Looks good", "Send it", "Okay", "Go ahead").
   - 'edit': User wants to change the action (e.g., switch from send_whatsapp_message to send_slack_message) or modify key parameters (e.g., phone_number, recipient_id, message content).
   - 'respond': User provides clarification or additional information without changing the action (e.g., updating the message content for send_whatsapp_message).
3. For 'edit':
   - Identify the new action (if changed) from the available tools.
   - Extract new args as a JSON object, ensuring compatibility with the tool's requirements (e.g., send_slack_message requires message, recipient_id).
4. For 'respond':
   - Capture the response as a string to guide the agent (e.g., new message content or instructions). Handle informal or partial inputs by inferring intent.
5. For 'accept':
   - Return an empty dict to proceed with the original action and args.
6. Output a JSON object with:
   - type: "accept", "edit", or "respond"
   - args: For 'edit', a dict with {"action": str, "args": dict}. For 'respond', a string. For 'accept', an empty dict.
7. Handle natural language responses by inferring intent without requiring explicit terms like "accept" or "edit". For example:
   - "Send it to his WhatsApp instead, +2348036926719" should be classified as 'edit' with a new action and args.
   - "Change the message to say meeting cancelled" should be classified as 'respond'.
   - "Looks fine" should be classified as 'accept'.

Examples:
1. Input:
   - Current action: send_whatsapp_message
   - Current args: {"message": "Hi Nonso", "phone_number": "+2348012345678"}
   - User response: Go ahead

2. Input:

   - Current args: {"message": "Hi", "phone_number": "+2348012345678"}
   - User response: Send him a DM instead. 'Alaye! Kilon sele?' U1234567890
   Output:
   {
     "type": "edit",
     "args": {
       "action": "send_slack_message",
       "args": {
         "message": "Alaye! Kilon sele?",
         "recipient_id": "U1234567890"
       }
     }
   }

3. Input:
   - Current action: send_whatsapp_message
   - Current args: {"message": "Hi", "phone_number": "+2348012345678"}
   - User response: Nah, tell him the meeting is cancelled
   Output:
   {
     "type": "respond",
     "args": "Change the message to 'Meeting is cancelled'"
   }

4. Input:
   - Current action: send_whatsapp_message
   - Current args: {"message": "Hi", "phone_number": "+2348012345678"}
   - User response: 
   Output:
   {
     "type": "respond",
     "args": "No response provided, please clarify"
   }

5. Input:
   - Current action: send_email
   - Current args: {"body": "Hi Nonso,\n\nJust a quick reminder that tomorrow's meeting is scheduled for 5 PM.\n\nBest regards", "recipient_email": "chinonsoodiakaaws@gmail.com", "subject": "Tomorrow's Meeting"}
   - User response: Send it to his WhatsApp instead. Tell him tomorrow's meeting is by 5pm. +2348036926719
   Output:
   {
     "type": "edit",
     "args": {
       "action": "send_whatsapp_message",
       "args": {
         "message": "Tomorrow's meeting is by 5 PM",
         "phone_number": "+2348036926719"
       }
